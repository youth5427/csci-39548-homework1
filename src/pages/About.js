            Grilld was founded in 1998 by two college friends with a passion for
            bold flavors. The first small-town shop quickly became popular for
            its smoky grilled burgers. <br></br>

            <br></br>By 2005, Grilld expanded to several cities and introduced
            convenient drive-thru service. In the 2010s, the brand shifted
            toward eco-friendly packaging and healthier menu choices. Today,
            Grilld is an international chain celebrated for its fresh taste and
            fast service.
